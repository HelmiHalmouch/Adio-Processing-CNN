# Audio-Processing-CNN
In this project, we apply the Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for audio processing. We use the ConvNets method. <br\>
The dataset used in this code are : UrbanSound8k wchich can been dowload for this woeb site : 
https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html
The 10 classes are : 
					1- Children playing <br\>
					2- Dog Barking <br\>
					3- Jackhammer <br\>
					4- Running  Engine <br\>
					5- Air conditioner <br\>
					6- Street music <br\>
					7- Gun shots <br\>
					8- Siren  <br\>
					9- Drilling <br\>
					10- Car Horn <br\>
